## Core Analytics Queries (TimescaleDB)

```python
# app/services/journal/analytics.py

async def get_performance_summary(
    db: AsyncSession,
    account_id: str,
    from_dt: datetime,
    to_dt: datetime,
) -> PerformanceSummary:
    """Compute win rate, profit factor, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown."""

    result = await db.execute(
        text("""
        WITH trade_metrics AS (

                CASE WHEN profit < 0 THEN ABS(profit) ELSE 0 END AS gross_loss

    )
    row = result.mappings().first()
    return PerformanceSummary(**row) if row else PerformanceSummary()
```

## Max Drawdown Calculation

```python
async def get_max_drawdown(
    db: AsyncSession,
    account_id: str,
    from_dt: datetime,
    to_dt: datetime,
) -> float:
    """Window-function based max drawdown over equity curve."""
    result = await db.execute(
        text("""

            SELECT
                snapshotted_at,

    )
    row = result.first()
    return float(row[0] or 0.0)
```

## Sharpe Ratio Calculation

```python
import numpy as np

async def get_sharpe_ratio(
    db: AsyncSession,
    account_id: str,
    from_dt: datetime,
    to_dt: datetime,
    risk_free_rate: float = 0.05,   # annual, default 5%

    """Annualized Sharpe ratio from daily returns."""
    result = await db.execute(
        text("""

        """),
        {"account_id": account_id, "from_dt": from_dt, "to_dt": to_dt},
    )
    rows = result.fetchall()
    if len(rows) < 5:
        return 0.0

    # Daily return = daily PnL / starting equity (approximation)
    pnls = np.array([float(r.daily_pnl) for r in rows])
    daily_rf = risk_free_rate / 252
    excess = pnls - daily_rf
    if excess.std() == 0:
        return 0.0
    return float((excess.mean() / excess.std()) * np.sqrt(252))
```

## Calendar Heatmap Data

```python
async def get_calendar_heatmap(
    db: AsyncSession,
    account_id: str,
    year: int,
) -> list[dict]:
    """Daily PnL for calendar heatmap visualization."""
    result = await db.execute(
        text("""

        FROM journal.trades
        WHERE account_id = :account_id
          AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM closed_at) = :year

        GROUP BY 1
        ORDER BY 1
        """),
        {"account_id": account_id, "year": year},
    )
    return [
        {"date": str(r.trade_date), "pnl": float(r.daily_pnl), "trades": r.trade_count}
        for r in result.fetchall()
    ]
```

## TimescaleDB Continuous Aggregate (daily_stats)

```sql
-- Migration: create continuous aggregate for daily stats
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW journal.daily_stats
WITH (timescaledb.continuous) AS
SELECT
    time_bucket('1 day', closed_at) AS day,
    account_id,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'closed') AS total_trades,
    SUM(profit) AS daily_pnl,
    SUM(profit) FILTER (WHERE profit > 0) AS gross_profit,
    SUM(ABS(profit)) FILTER (WHERE profit < 0) AS gross_loss,
    AVG(profit) FILTER (WHERE profit > 0) AS avg_win,
    AVG(profit) FILTER (WHERE profit < 0) AS avg_loss
FROM journal.trades
GROUP BY day, account_id
WITH NO DATA;

-- Refresh policy: auto-refresh every hour
SELECT add_continuous_aggregate_policy(
    'journal.daily_stats',
    start_offset => INTERVAL '7 days',
    end_offset => INTERVAL '1 hour',
    schedule_interval => INTERVAL '1 hour'
);
```

## Pydantic Response Schemas

```python
# app/schemas/journal.py
from pydantic import BaseModel
from decimal import Decimal

class PerformanceSummary(BaseModel):
    total_trades: int = 0
    wins: int = 0
    win_rate: Decimal = Decimal("0")
    total_pnl: Decimal = Decimal("0")
    profit_factor: Decimal | None = None
    avg_win: Decimal | None = None
    avg_loss: Decimal | None = None
    sharpe_ratio: float = 0.0
    max_drawdown: float = 0.0

class CalendarDay(BaseModel):
    date: str          # ISO date "2024-03-15"
    pnl: Decimal
    trades: int

class JournalEntry(BaseModel):
    id: str
    trade_ticket: int
    account_id: str
    notes: str
    tags: list[str] = []
    screenshots: list[str] = []    # R2 object keys
    emotional_state: str | None = None  # "confident", "fearful", "neutral"
    created_at: datetime
```

## Anti-Patterns

```
✗ Computing drawdown in Python loop (10k+ trades — use SQL window functions)
✗ Missing NULL guards on profit_factor (division by zero on all-winning accounts)
✗ No TimescaleDB continuous aggregates (daily stats would be O(n) every request)
✗ Returning raw profit without currency context
✗ Mixing open and closed trades in performance stats (always filter status='closed')
✗ Sharpe ratio without annualization factor (√252 for daily data)
✗ Ignoring swap and commission in PnL calculations
✗ No pagination on trade history endpoint (10k trades crashes mobile)
```
